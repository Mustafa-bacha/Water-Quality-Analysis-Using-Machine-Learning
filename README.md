# Water-Quality-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning
The Water Quality Analysis Using  Machine Learning project aims to develop a predictive model to classify water samples as safe or unsafe  for consumption based on key water quality indicators. This project will utilize machine learning  techniques to analyze data on water quality and predict water potability.
